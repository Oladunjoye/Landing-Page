        <p>Listening to the sound of waves, hitting the rocks, and the cool breeze
            playing with my hairlocks. I look at the setting sun, as i lean back and 
            smile. For the first time, in a long while, my mind was quiet. My soul was
            speaking and my heart got what it was seeking.
            Their lights are dim on the horizon, two ships headed East. Soft blue glow,
            barely seen from this vacant shoreline. Random stars begin peeking through
            the thinning cloud cover, in the remaining bit of light. Scurry about, free 
            of human interruption, the white crest of breaking waves, glimpses in the 
            darkness. This is when the beach awakens. This is when i am at home, breathing
            the life of the sea.
