            <p>Listening to the sound of waves, hitting the rocks, and the cool breeze
                playing with my hairlocks. I look at the setting sun, as i lean back and 
                smile. For the first time, in a long while, my mind was quiet. My soul was
                speaking and my heart got what it was seeking.
                Their lights are dim on the horizon, two ships headed East. Soft blue glow,
                barely seen from this vacant shoreline. Random stars begin peeking through
                the thinning cloud cover, in the remaining bit of light. Scurry about, free 
                of human interruption, the white crest of breaking waves, glimpses in the 
                darkness. This is when the beach awakens. This is when i am at home, breathing
                the life of the sea. </p>
